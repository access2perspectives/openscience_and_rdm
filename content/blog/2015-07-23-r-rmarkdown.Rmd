```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

# blogdown 

blog entries use the bookdown package, based on RMarkdown, itself using the markdown synthax. Some functions (like figure numbering) will only be available while building/serving the website, not when knitting the document.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

You can also use python code, using the reticulate package:

```{python adding}
# This program adds two numbers

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

# Add two numbers
sum1 = float(num1) + float(num2)

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum1))
```

Note that values are kept from one R chunk to the next, but cannot be ported from python chunk into r chunks:
```{r}
exists("fit")

exists("sum1")
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
