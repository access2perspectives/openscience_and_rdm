Open science and research data management: a successful workshop
====================

With the digitalisation of the scientific workflow, researchers are faced with new  challenges: While open FAIR data is already a standard they have to comply with, transparency and reproducibility of the research start to be recognised as good scientific practices. We think it is possible for researcher to achieve that, while being more efficient in their daily work. We therefore designed a specific open science and research data management workshop, and performed our first run in November for the Sonderforschungsbereich 874
at the 
Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum.  While research data management skills was at the center of the course, an overview of open access, analysis and experiments reproducibility and online presence was also given. Git, Gitlab and Rstudio were the tools introduced to help them use a more open and efficient workflow.

 
The projects of the nine neurosciences PhD students who participated were ranging from computer simulation to protein quantification, via human surveys. The students enjoyed the workshop, particularly the nice atmosphere, the good balance between lectures and practical exercises and the "nice summary of open science resources and opportunities" (fig.1).  
 As expected from an first run, there is room for improvement, especially in the technical exercise part, where we spend too much time resolving issues. Some students found it a bit too fast sometimes and lost track of the workshop structure.
In general, the focus on research data management was appreciated by early PhD students, while late PhDs had the impression it was too late for them.

We are looking forward to continue our collaboration with the university of Bochum. We will make everything to keep the nice atmosphere while being be even better at bringing skills and tools to efficiently embrace open science and open FAIR data.
