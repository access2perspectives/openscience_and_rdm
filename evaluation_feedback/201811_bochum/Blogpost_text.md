Open science and research data management: a workshop review
====================

With the digitalisation of the scientific workflow, researchers are faced with new challenges: While Open FAIR data is already a standard they have to comply with, transparency and reproducibility of the research afre only starting to being recognised as good scientific practices. We think it is possible for researchers to achieve that, while being more efficient in their daily work. We therefore designed a specific Open Science and Research Data Management workshop, and performed our first run in November for the Sonderforschungsbereich 874 at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum (are we sure they want to be mentioned in a publication) can you et their written approval?).  While research data management skills was at the center of the course, an overview of Open Access, Data Analysis, Experimental Reproducibility and Online Presence was also part of the course content. Git, Gitlab and Rstudio were the tools introduced to help participants practise a more open and efficient workflow.

 
The projects of the nine Neuroscience PhD students who participated were ranging from computer simulation to protein quantification via human surveys. The students enjoyed the workshop, particularly the nice atmosphere, the good balance between lectures and practical exercises and the "nice summary of open science resources and opportunities" (fig.1).  

As expected from the first run, there is room for improvement, especially in the technical exercise part, where we spent too much time resolving issues. Some students found it a bit too fast sometimes and had difficulties following the workshop structure. The focus on research data management was appreciated by early PhD students, while late PhDs had the impression it was too late for them.

We are looking forward to continuing our collaboration with the University of Bochum and continuesly work on improving delivery of the skills and tools necessary for scientists at the university of Bochum and other researtch institutions to easily and efficiently embrace Open Science and FAIR Data Management.
