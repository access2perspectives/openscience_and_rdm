Open science and research data management: a successful workshop
====================

In November 2018, we performed our first workshop with emphasis on open science and research data management, aimed at 9 PhD students working in neurosciences (SFB-874, in Bochum). The students enjoyed particularly the nice atmosphere, the good balance between lectures and practical exercises and the "nice summary of open science resources and opportunities". We indeed covered many different topics (open science overview, open access, open methodology, open data, reproducibility crisis and reproducible reports, version control, data archive) and tools (gitlab, git, markdown, Rstudio). Our focus on research data management was appreciated by early PhD, while late PhDs had the impression it was too late. 

On the part we could improve, we spent too much time on the first exercice on the first day and resolving issues when installing the link between Rstudio and gitlab on the second day. Some students found it a bit too fast sometimes and lost track of the workshop structure. In particular, demos at the computer are problematic, and the use of hands-on could make things easier.
