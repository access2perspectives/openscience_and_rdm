Open science and research data management: a workshop review
====================

With the digitization of the scientific workflow, researchers are faced with new challenges: While Open FAIR data is already a standard they have to comply with, transparency and reproducibility of the research are only starting to being recognized as good scientific practices. We think it is possible for researchers to achieve that, while being more efficient in their daily work. We therefore designed a specific Open Science and Research Data Management workshop, and performed our first run in November.  While research data management skills was at the center of the course, an overview of Open Access, Data Analysis, Experimental Reproducibility and Online Presence was also part of the course content. Git, Gitlab and Rstudio were the tools introduced to help participants practice a more open and efficient workflow.

 
The projects of the nine PhD students who participated were ranging from computer simulation to protein quantification via human surveys. The students enjoyed the workshop, particularly the nice atmosphere, the good balance between lectures and practical exercises and the "nice summary of open science resources and opportunities" (fig.1).

As expected from the first run, there is room for improvement, especially in the technical exercise part, where we spent too much time resolving issues. Some students found it a bit too fast sometimes and had difficulties following the workshop structure. The focus on research data management was appreciated by early PhD students, while late PhD's had the impression it was too late for them.

Learning from this first round, we are working to offer an even better workshop in 2019, in order to best deliver the skills and tools necessary for scientists to easily and efficiently embrace Open Science and FAIR Data Management.
