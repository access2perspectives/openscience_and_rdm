Introduction of each participant: 1min for name, institute, reason to do science (card), exeriment to present (card with name)

From ethical values collected -> science should be collaborative, transparent and inclusive -> open science

what is open science.
What is open data, who ask for it

Why open data !!
  - presentation 

workshop outline, code of conduct, technical questions, link to collaborative notes (hack.md)






#10:00-10:45

Introduction to github: get you page ready in the website.
Presentation of the website, front and back

step 0: login, be part of the gitlab group, (fork the website from github?)
step 1:  change the yml page, pull request it.
step 2: add picture, modify yml
step 3: add your page (create new file), write shortly what your experiment is about.
sep 4:  access to the repo (admin rights)
