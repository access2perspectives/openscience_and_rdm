## Goals

Preventing behaviors which are **irreconcilable with** the essence of science itself as a methodical, systematic process of research aimed at **gaining knowledge based on verifiable results** and that **destroy public trust** in the reliability of scientific results as well as the trust of scientists among themselves.

## What is it

- policies
- define on how to teach students
- define misconduct
- define how misconduct is reported and dealt with (mediation office/Ombudsstelle)


## The obviously wrong 

- plagiat
- stealing of ideas
- Creation of data
- Destruction  of others material or data 

## The less obvious 

- Adding authors who did nothing to a manuscript
other principles:
- doubt your own results
- provide results in a way they are reproducible
- document the data
- primary data saved for 10 years
