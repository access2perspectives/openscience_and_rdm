## What do we need to reproduce the analysis?

- data
- detailed documentation:
    - What was done
    - What software was used (version number)
    - What dependencies of that software

## Not as straightforward as it seems !

- data filtering
- error in manual handling of the data (copy paste actions, sort,...)
- different software (versions) have different outputs
- ...

## Do things on the go

## First things to consider

1. Document all your analysis and test whether your documentation is enough.
2. Get rid of excel for data analysis
3. I said do not use excel !

## No excel, then what ?

- R or/and python
- matlab: not open source
- SPSS and others: less reproducible, but can work with good documentation.

## let's get started with a little bit of Rstudio !

- Install R and Rstudio
- New file Rscript
- Import dataset, name it "studentage"
- copy history to source
- calculate mean(age)
- make a boxplot of age
