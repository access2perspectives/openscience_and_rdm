# WHAT SOLUTION ??

## Version control: manual solution

- Increasing numbers: 01-99, or 001-999 or ISO date (end or beginning of file name)
- Version history file: log of changes 
- Also possible: all old version in a sub-folder, keep only last version in the main folder.

## Automation via Git

- "git commit"" is like
    - adding a snapshot of file in an invisible folder
    - writing a comment in the version history
- Result:
    - Only latest version visible
    - All version saved (although less accessible)
    - Version history, with messages
    
- In addition:
    - Deleted files are still there somewhere !
    - only changes are saved in the snapshot -> need less storage space <br> !! work with text files only, not binaries (.csv, .txt, .md but not .docs, .xlsx, .jpg,… files)

## Using git in practice

- Command lines for nerds !
- Rstudio (github desktop,…), for creation, commits and simple stuff
- Git specific software (Sourcetree, tortoise,…) for more complex processes (merge, complex history,…)
- Problems -> google error message -> stack overflow solution (mostly via git commands, shell button on Rstudio)

# gitlab and github

# Using issues

- create issues
- add labels
- add assignee
- start the discussion !

# Why using gitlab ?

## The Obvious

- Backup of your files
- Possible to work from different machines
- Version history
- Follow who did what
- Communication via issues

## Careful:

- Pull when starting to work
- Push when the work is done
- Use branches to deal with merging problems later (especially if working in groups)
- try to pull request on master often.

## gitlab versus GitHub

- GitHub belongs to microsoft
- No export of issues and wiki on GitHub
- larger community on GitHub
- zenodo integration only on GitHub
- GitHub slightly easier at start
