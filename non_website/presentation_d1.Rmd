- No exclusionary language or microaggressions (beware of jokes)
- React if you see unfit behavior
- Please don’t say: “Comment X wasn’t sexist!”, apologize and move on.

# Question ?

# open collaboration: 

- Version control and git: the basics of “git commit”
- Using Gitlab / GitHub

##Versioning: the problem

- …
- thesis-final
- thesis-final2,thesis-final3, thesis-final4, thesis-final4-corr
- thesis-final-final
- …
- thesis-final-final-corr_Prof-3-submitted-rev2 ?

## Version control: manual solution

- Increasing numbers: 01-99, or 001-999 or ISO date (end or beginning of file name)
- Version history file: log of changes 
- Also possible: all old version in a sub-folder, keep only last version in the main folder.
